# Managing AWS infrastructure through the AWS Management Console poses two key challenges:

## Challenge 1: Manual Resource Creation
Every time a resource needs to be created, such as an EC2 Launch Template, it involves filling out forms, making it a manual activity.

## Challenge 2: Complex Infrastructure Deployment
Deploying a web application with security, high availability, and scalability features requires creating and integrating various resources, such as Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups, Security Groups, etc. Ensuring proper configuration and sequence for deletion becomes cumbersome.

```Solution```:

To overcome these challenges, we're adopting Terraform, a tool that enables infrastructure deployment and management as code (IaC).

## Advantages of Terraform:
- Flexible deployment and management of infrastructure on AWS.
- Infrastructure defined as code (Terraform templates), making it easier to create, modify, and maintain.
- Allows for automated provisioning and deprovisioning of resources.

# Terraform Introduction

Terraform is a tool developed by HashiCorp for automating infrastructure provisioning. It supports multiple providers, enabling automation across various platforms. While there might be slight differences in implementation, the core workflow remains consistent across providers.

## Resources:

- **Website**: [Terraform Official Website](https://www.terraform.io/)
- **Documentation**: [Official Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)
- **List of Providers**: [HashiCorp Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers)

To begin using Terraform, the software must be installed on your development system. The development system is where you write and execute Terraform code. This typically refers to your local system.

## Installing Terraform on Windows

### 1. Download Terraform Binary

- Go to the [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) page on the official Terraform website. 
- Download the Terraform binary for Windows.
- Select (AMD64 Processor) 

### 2. Extract Terraform Binary

- Once downloaded, extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice on your Windows system.

### 3. Add Terraform to PATH

- Open "System (Control Panel)" > "Advanced system settings" > "Environment Variables...".
- Under "System variables", select the `Path` variable and click "Edit...".
- Add the full path to the directory where Terraform binary (`terraform.exe`) is located.
- Click "OK" on all windows to apply the changes.

### 4. Verify Installation

- Open a new command prompt window.
- Type `terraform --version` and press Enter to verify that Terraform is installed correctly.

## Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI)

Terraform operates primarily through a command-line interface (CLI). There is no graphical user interface (GUI) provided for Terraform.

## Development Environment
When working with Terraform, it's common to configure infrastructure, including web servers, on Linux systems. Running commands on Windows Command Prompt can be challenging as it does not support traditional Linux commands.
It's advisable to have a bash shell installed on your Windows system for easier compatibility with Linux commands. If you're using Windows, Git Bash is a recommended option. For Linux and macOS, bash is typically already installed.

## Installing Git Bash on Windows

### Downloading Git Bash

1. Open your web browser.
2. Search for "Git Bash download".
3. Visit the official Git website [here](https://git-scm.com/).
4. Download the Git for Windows installer (typically a .exe file).
5. Choose the appropriate version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).

### Installing Git Bash

1. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded .exe file.
2. Double-click on the installer file to start the installation process.
3. Follow the installation wizard instructions:
    - Click "Next" to proceed.
    - Read and accept the license agreement.
    - Choose the installation directory (default is recommended).
    - Select components to install (default options are recommended).
    - Choose the start menu folder (default is recommended).
    - Select the desired additional tasks (e.g., creating desktop icon).
    - Click "Next" to begin the installation.
    - Wait for the installation process to complete.
    - Click "Finish" to exit the installer.

### Verifying Git Bash Installation

1. Once installation is complete, you can verify that Git Bash has been installed successfully:
    - Go to the Start menu.
    - Search for "Git Bash" or look for it in the installed programs list.
    - Open Git Bash to launch the terminal.
2. Alternatively, you can open a command prompt and type `git --version` to check if Git is installed and to see the installed version. 

## Why VS Code?

When it comes to writing code, using a text editor like Notepad can be challenging. Programming languages have strict syntax rules, and it's crucial to maintain proper formatting and structure.
As a DevOps Engineer or Automation Engineer, our responsibility is to streamline development processes and ensure efficient code writing and debugging. This is where VS Code comes into play.

### Key Reasons for Using VS Code:

- ```Syntax Highlighting```: VS Code provides syntax highlighting for various programming languages, making it easier to identify and correct errors.
- ```Intellisense```: It offers intelligent code completion and suggestions, helping developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
- ```Debugging Support```: VS Code comes with built-in debugging capabilities, allowing developers to debug their code directly within the editor.
- ```Extensions```: It supports a wide range of extensions that enhance functionality, such as Git integration, linters, and language support extensions.
- ```Customization```: VS Code can be customized to suit individual preferences and workflows, improving productivity and efficiency.

By using VS Code, we can effectively fulfill our role as DevOps or Automation Engineers by ensuring smooth development processes and high-quality code.

## Installing Visual Studio Code on Windows

## VS Code Extensions for Terraform Development

When working with Terraform code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), there are several extensions available that enhance the development experience by providing suggestions and assistance in identifying and fixing issues:

**Terraform Extension:**
- This official Terraform extension provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and rich language support for Terraform configuration files.
- [Link to Terraform Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform)

## Fundamental Concepts of Terraform
- Terraform operates on a declarative model, allowing users to define infrastructure configurations.
- Terraform code adheres to a predefined syntax.
- The structure of Terraform code is organized into blocks.
- Each block in Terraform requires a name for identification and reference.
- Files containing Terraform code should have a ".tf" extension.

## AWS Provider

- **Documentation**: [AWS Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)
- **Terraform AWS Provider**: [AWS Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)

## Write Your First Terraform Code
- To begin your journey with Terraform, let's create your first Terraform configuration file named `main.tf` and add the following code to `main.tf

```hcl
# main.tf

# Block 1: AWS Provider Configuration
provider "aws" {
    region     = "us-east-1"
    access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your AWS access key
    secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your AWS secret key
}

# Block 2: AWS EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "webserver" { 
    ami           = "ami-0d7a109bf30624c99"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    key_name      = "YOUR_KEY_PAIR_NAME_HERE"  # Replace with your EC2 key pair name
}
```

## Execution Steps - Terraform WorkFlow 

### Step 1: Initialize Terraform
```
terraform init
```
- Initializes Terraform and downloads required plugins for AWS provider.
- Creates a .terraform folder to store downloaded plugins.

### Step 2: Plan Execution
```
terraform plan
```
- Generates an execution plan showing what will be created, modified, or destroyed.
- Doesn't make any actual changes.

### Step 3: Apply Execution Plan
```
terraform apply
```
- Executes the planned changes.
- Prompts for confirmation before applying changes.
- Creates resources defined in Terraform configuration.

### Step 4: Destroy Resources
```
terraform destroy
```
- Destroys all resources created by Terraform.
- Prompts for confirmation before destroying resources.

## Further Considerations
- Ensure your present working directory is where your Terraform files are located.
- Access key and secret key defined in the provider block are used to authenticate with AWS programmatically.
- Terraform applies changes based on the defined configuration, using credentials to connect to AWS and execute resources.
- When running terraform apply again after resources are already created, Terraform checks for changes. If no changes are detected, it informs that there are no changes to apply.
