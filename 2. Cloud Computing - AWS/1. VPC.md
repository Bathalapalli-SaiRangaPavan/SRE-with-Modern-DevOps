# AWS Virtual Datacenter Setup (VPC - Virtual Private Cloud)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an AWS service that lets you launch resources in a virtual network of your own design. With VPC, you have control over IP address ranges, subnets, and network settings, creating a secure environment for your applications and services in the cloud.

## Lab Instructions

### Step 1: Create VPC
- **Search**: VPC 
- **Select the region** to set up the VPC - us-east-1a
- **Create VPC**: 
  - Name tag: SRE-VPC-01
  - IPV4 CIDR: 192.168.0.0/16 
  - Tenancy: default
- Click (Create VPC)

### Step 2: Create Private Subnet
- **Click**: Subnets
- **VPC ID**: Select vpc- SRE-VPC-01
  - **Subnet name**: private-subnet-01 
  - **Availability zones**: 1a
  - **IPV4 Subnet CIDR block**: 192.168.1.0/24 
- Click (create subnet)

### Step 3: Create Public Subnet
- **Click**: Subnets 
- **VPC ID**: Select vpc- SRE-VPC-01 
  - **Subnet name**: public-subnet-01 
  - **Availability zones**: 1b
  - **IPV4 Subnet CIDR block**: 192.168.2.0/24 
- Click (create subnet)

### Step 4: Create Private Route Table
- **Click**: Route table 
  - **Name**: Private-Route-Table 
  - **VPC**: Select vpc - SRE-VPC-01
- Click (Create Route table)
- **Edit subnet associations** and select private subnet 

### Step 5: Create Public Route Table
- **Click**: Route table 
  - **Name**: Public-Route-Table
  - **VPC**: Select vpc - SRE-VPC-01
- Click (Create Route table) 
- **Edit subnet associations** and select public subnet 
- **Create Internet Gateway**:
  - Name tag: SRE-INTERNET GATEWAY
- Click (Create Internet Gateway)
- Attach it to VPC (actions -> attach to vpc)

### Step 6: Create EC2 Instances
- **Create EC2 instance** in the VPC 
  - Name: web app
  - Network settings: select VPC (vpc- SRE-VPC-01), public subnet
- **Security group**: select the VPC (SRE-VPC-SG), open port 22

- **Create EC2 instance** in the VPC 
  - Name: DB app
  - Network settings: select VPC (vpc- SRE-VPC-01), private subnet

Now, when you try to access the resources, the ones in the public subnet are accessible. However, for resources in the private subnet, they are not accessible externally as it is a private subnet without any public IP addresses.

## Additional Notes
- EC2 servers are bound with network interface cards, allowing multiple IPs.
- To create multiple network interface cards:
  - Click (actions) 
  - Click (manage IP address) 
  - Click (allow) 
  - Click (save) 

This setup ensures servers within the same VPC can communicate via private IPs using local gateways, and each subnet has its respective routing table for proper network traffic management.

- The VPC named "SRE-VPC-01" spans across two availability zones (us-east-1a and us-east-1b) and has the CIDR block 192.168.0.0/16.
- Within the VPC, there are two subnets: a public subnet (192.168.2.0/24) and a private subnet (192.168.1.0/24), each located in different availability zones.
- There are two route tables: one for the public subnet (Public-Route-Table) and one for the private subnet (Private-Route-Table). The public route table has a route to the Internet Gateway to allow outbound internet access, while the private route table has a local route only.
- An Internet Gateway (SRE-INTERNET-GATEWAY) is attached to the VPC to enable internet access for resources in the public subnet.
- Security groups are set up to control inbound and outbound traffic to the EC2 instances.
- EC2 instances named "web app" and "DB app" are deployed within the VPC. The "web app" instance is placed in the public subnet, allowing it to have a public IP address and internet access. The "DB app" instance is placed in the private subnet, ensuring it doesn't have a public IP address and is not directly accessible from the internet.
