## What is a Network?
A network refers to the communication infrastructure established between two or more computers or servers. When servers or computers interact with each other, they form a network. In simpler terms, if Server A and Server B are communicating, they are considered to be part of the same network. The fundamental concept of a network revolves around the exchange of data between at least two entities.

### Key Points:
- A network is formed when there is communication between servers or computers.
- At least two servers or computers are required for a network to exist.
- If a server or computer is not communicating with any other, it is not considered part of any network.
- Real-life example: Just like individuals need interactions to form a social network, servers or computers need communication to form a digital network.

## What is IP?
- An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device in a network to facilitate communication. It serves as an address for devices to send and receive data within a network. IP addresses are typically represented in decimal format, such as 192.168.1.10, which is the standard IPv4 format. IPv4 addresses consist of four fields separated by periods, with each field ranging from 0 to 255. These addresses are converted into binary format (32 bits) for machine understanding.
- Devices within the same network can communicate with each other using their assigned IP addresses. However, devices in different networks typically cannot communicate directly unless facilitated by a router or gateway.
- It's possible to assign the same IP address to devices in different networks, but they must be in separate networks for proper communication. The IP address also includes a network ID, which helps determine whether devices are in the same network or not.

## Definition of Network ID:
- The network ID is the IP address used to identify the network itself rather than any specific computer within the network. It serves as a unique identifier for the network segment to which devices belong.
### Determining Network Affiliation:
- When managing multiple servers, it's crucial to ascertain whether two servers belong to the same network. If they are part of the same network, they can communicate directly; otherwise, communication may require routing through gateways. By comparing the IP addresses assigned to the servers, it becomes possible to determine whether they share the same network ID, thereby establishing their network affiliation. This distinction facilitates effective network management and ensures seamless communication between devices within the same network segment.

# Datacenter Setup Guide

## Scenario
You are tasked with building a datacenter consisting of 300 servers. The objective is to configure these servers to communicate with each other within the network.

## IP Address Configuration
Given IP address range: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255.

## Determining Network ID
To establish communication within the network, define a network ID that encompasses all 300 servers.

## Selecting Network ID
- Network ID should end with 0.
- All non-zero numbers in the IP address pertain to the network part.
- Choose a network ID that accommodates all servers.

### Chosen Network ID
192.168.1.0

## IP Address Assignment
- Assign IP addresses within the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255.
- All IP addresses share the same network ID: 192.168.1.0.

## Understanding Network ID
- Network ID helps determine whether given IP addresses belong to the same network.
- IP addresses with matching network IDs can communicate directly.

## CIDR Notation and Address Range
- CIDR notation simplifies network identification and allocation.
- Class C (/24) CIDR: 192.168.1.0/24 (0-255 hosts)
- Class B (/16) CIDR: 192.168.0.0/16 (0-65,535 hosts)
- Class A (/8) CIDR: 192.0.0.0/8 (0-16,777,215 hosts)

## Best Practice
- Adhere to standard CIDR ranges to avoid confusion.
- Class C (/24) for smaller networks, Class B (/16) for larger ones.

## Conclusion
For configuring 300 servers in a single datacenter, the recommended CIDR block is Class B (/16) to accommodate all servers effectively.

**Note:** Network ID and CIDR notation are crucial for determining network affiliation and facilitating seamless communication between devices within the same network segment.


## Switch vs Router

### Switch
- Used to connect multiple servers within the same network.
- Provides connectivity within the network segment.
- Enables communication between devices with matching IP addresses and network IDs.
- Does not facilitate communication between devices in different networks by default.

### Router
- Acts as a gateway between different networks.
- Required to enable communication between devices in different networks.
- Routes traffic from one network to another based on destination IP addresses.
- Helps establish connectivity between devices with different network IDs.

## Scenario: Datacenter Setup
- **Servers**: 
  - Server A: 192.168.1.10/24 
  - Server B: 192.168.1.20/24 
  - Server C: 192.168.3.10/24 
  - Server D: 192.168.2.20/16
- **Objective**: Configure servers in the datacenter for business operations.

### Network Configuration
- **CIDR**: 192.168.0.0/16
- Dividing /16 network into smaller subnetworks for server allocation.

### Subnets
- **Private Subnet**: 
  - Used for internal communication within the datacenter.
  - Includes servers with private IP addresses (e.g., Server A and Server B).
- **Public Subnet**: 
  - Used for servers accessible over the internet.
  - Includes servers with public IP addresses (e.g., Server C).

### IP Addresses
- **Private IP**: 
  - Assigned to devices within the private subnet.
  - Used for internal communication.
  - Example: 192.168.1.10
- **Public IP**: 
  - Assigned to devices within the public subnet.
  - Used for external communication over the internet.
  - Example: 192.168.3.10

### Communication Within Datacenter
- Servers within the same subnetwork (e.g., private subnet) can communicate using private IPs.
- For communication between servers in different subnetworks, a router (gateway) is required.

### Connectivity
- **Local Gateway**:
  - Connects devices within the same network (e.g., private subnet).
  - Routes traffic internally within the datacenter.
- **Default Gateway**:
  - Handles traffic destined for unknown or external networks.
  - Routes traffic outside the datacenter to the internet.
- **Internet Gateway**:
  - Facilitates communication between devices in the datacenter and external clients over the internet.

### Routing Tables
- Routing tables dictate how traffic is routed to its destination.
- Must be updated to facilitate communication between devices in different networks.
- Include entries for local, default, and internet gateways to route traffic accordingly.

## Conclusion
- Switches facilitate internal connectivity within a network segment.
- Routers enable communication between devices in different networks.
- Proper network configuration, including routing tables, is essential for seamless communication within and outside the datacenter.
